# qtltools

qtltools are a collection of functions to interact with the R package r/qtl by Carl Broman. They are particularly aimed at plotting the positions and effect sizes from QTL analyses from multiple replicate experiments. The package is written with Arabisopsis thaliana in mind, but in principle the functions should work for any mapped genome.
